# Working in Python

In this section, we will cover many important computing fundamtentals using the python programming language. These fundamentals are transferrable between many programming languages so laying a strong foundation will prove benfeficail. 

## Python Introduction

Python is an interpreted, high-level programming language. Python is often associated as a Object Oriented Programming language as well meaning that objects within the programs can contain data. The first example of an object in python is a variable. 

```{python}
# Words after the pound (#) sign are comments. These lines are ignored when the program runs!
myvar = 10

result = myvar*10

result
```

The object 'myvar' is a python variable. In the example above, it stores the value 10.
